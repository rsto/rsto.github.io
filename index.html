    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>I am rsto, a software developer mainly working on network services, systems engineering and character encodings.
    In real life, my name is Robert Stepanek and I'm based in Vienna, Austria.
    </p>
    <h2>what I am currently doing</h2>
    <p>
       Currently, I’m happy to contract at <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">FastMail</a>,
       where I am one of the major contributors to the
       <a href="https://www.cyrusimap.org/">Cyrus IMAP project</a>. It’s all open-source 
       in my Github <a href="https://github.com/rsto"><span>repo</span></a>.
       Also sponsored by FastMail, I am member of the <a href="https://www.calconnect.org/">CalConnect Calendaring Consortium</a>,
       where I work on defining a new calendaring data model. Go check out our IETF RFC
       <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-jenkins-jscalendar/">draft</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>what I have done previously</h2>
    <p>
       Most of my previous code is proprietary and notably tons of it run in the
       provisioning systems of a large Austrian <a href="https://www.a1.net">telecommunications</a>
       provider.
    </p>
    <p>Still, in the last two decades I found time to contribute anything from
       one-liners up to klocs to at least the following open-source projects:
       <a href="https://xapian.org/">Xapian</a>,
       <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/webdav">x/net/webdav</a>,
       <a href="https://github.com/libical">libical</a>,
       <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/news.html">libxml</a>,
       <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-vobject/">SabreDAV</a>.
       I also vaguely recall having contributed a bug fix to
       <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>,
       <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">GNU Hurd</a> and
       being the sole user of my custom bootloader for a <a href="http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/systems/personal.html">SGI Personal Iris</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       Besides churning code, I worked about six years as a business consultant
       in telecommunications at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">one</a> of the Big 5 consulting
       firms. I also launched a few business ventures, all of which the dust of time has settled on.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2004 I graduated as MSc in Computer Science at University of Technology Vienna (TU Wien)
    writing the modeler code for photorealistic ocean waves at the Computer Graphics group.
    In 2006 I worked as research assistant at Department of Theoretical Informatics at
    University of Technology Munich (TUM).
    </p>
    <p>
    In 1998 I co-founded a free <a href="http://lo-res.org/">web host</a>
    and ran it over a decade. We hosted our own
    radio show and organized free Linux workshops.
